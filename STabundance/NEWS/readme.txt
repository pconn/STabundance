The R package STabundance includes all the code and data to recreate spatio-temporal statistical analyses as reported 
in Conn et al.'s "Using spatio-temporal statistical models to estimate animal abundance and infer ecological dynamics 
from survey counts."

The scripts used to conduct these analyses are found in the "inst" subdirectory.  In particular, the script 
"run_generic_sims.R" conducts "generic simulations," the script "run_BOSS_ST_sims.R" conducts spotted seal simulations, 
and "run_spotted_Bering.R" conducts analysis of the actual spotted seal dataset.

Package version 0.91 updates analysis grid for simulated data to be exactly the same as for the Spotted seal analysis (the
analysis grid in the paper differs by one cell) - thus simulated Bering Sea results will not be completely identical to those in 
the paper appendices.
